	What is the stack?
	How are functions called?
	Where do arguments to a function go?
	Where do local variables go?

Solve the binary challenges available on my github: https://github.com/blankwall/Odds-and-Ends/tree/master/week_2_hn

Walk through at a minimum the first stack level with them

All the challenges are labeled with a difficulty level strongly encourage solving the two level 1's and the one level 2 first. They are simple!
